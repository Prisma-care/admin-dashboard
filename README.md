# Prisma Dashboard

## About

Prisma is an app that strengthens the relationship between people with memory loss and the people close to them. It does this by providing a living, collaborative digital photo album that can be populated with content of interest to these people.

This repository hosts the dashboard for the project. For now, it serves as a content manager. Default albums and heritage assets for every new loved one are managed here.
The dashboard communicates with our [central API](https://github.com/Prisma/api).

## History

Project Prisma was part of [Open Knowledge Belgium](https://www.openknowledge.be/)'s [open Summer of Code 2017](http://2017.summerofcode.be/). A student team coached by Frederik Vincx [(@fritsbits)](https://github.com/fritsbits) worked on it in July 2017:

* Michiel Leyman ([@MichielLeyman](https://github.com/MichielLeyman)) - backend & project management
* Simon Westerlinck ([@siimonco](https://github.com/siimonco)) - backend & database modelling
* Jean-Pacifique Mboynincungu ([@oxnoctisxo](https://github.com/oxnoctisxo)) - frontend system analysis
* Thor Galle ([@th0rgall](https://github.com/th0rgall)) - frontend & product owner

The app was conceived in a one-month collaborative design project in a care home in Zonhoven, Belgium, in January 2017. Together with personnel and dementia design researchers the team honed in on a static prototype that was later refined during the Open Summer of Code. More info about it in [this blog post](http://www.frederikvincx.com/project-prisma-helping-people-with-dementia/).
