# Prisma Dashboard

## About

Prisma is an app that strengthens the relationship between people with memory loss and the people close to them. It does this by providing a living, collaborative digital photo album that can be populated with content of interest to these people.

This repository hosts the dashboard for the project. For now, it serves as a content manager. Default albums and heritage assets for every new loved one are managed here.
The dashboard communicates with our [central API](https://github.com/Prisma/api).
